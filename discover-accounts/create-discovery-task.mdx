title: "Create account discovery task"
---

**Account Discovery** refers to the automatic identification of accounts on servers. The system supports syncing discovered accounts to JumpServer and associating accounts with corresponding assets. 

Before starting account discovery, you need to create a **high-privilege** account for the asset, because JumpServer will use this account to retrieve other accounts during task execution.
