## About user

In JumpServer, **User** is a core entity of the system, used for logging in and accessing assets, and also serves as the fundamental object for administrators to grant resource permissions. 

All users are unique globally and can be assigned multiple system roles, thereby inheriting the corresponding system-level permissions. 

In the Enterprise edition, a user can belong to multiple organizations and have multiple organization roles, enabling fine-grained permission control across or within organizations.
