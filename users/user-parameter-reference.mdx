<ParamField path="Groups" type="string[]">
  User groups are used for organizing and managing users. A user can belong to multiple groups.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="Password setting" type="string">
  (Create local user only) Choose the method for setting the password for a newly created user.

  - Reset link will be generated and sent to the user

    > This will send a password setup email to the user. The user can log in after resetting the password as instructed.

  - Set password

    > Manually set password. The user can log in directly with this password.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="Change secret" type="boolean">
  (Edit local user only) When editing a user, check to update the user's password.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="Password" type="string">
  (Local user only) The user can log in to the system using this password. 

  Password rules can be configured in the system settings, including requirements for length, uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

  When `Password must be changed during next login` is checked, the user will be required to change the password immediately after the first successful login.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="MFA" type="string">
  Configure the Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) policy for a single user.

  - Disabled

    > MFA is disabled by default, but users can enable it from their profile page. 

  - Enabled

    > MFA is enabled for the user, but they can disable it from their profile page.

  - Force enabled

    > MFA is enforced for the user, and they cannot disable it.

  You can also configure a global MFA policy in the system settings. For more information, see [Global MFA](/docs/security/auth-security#global-mfa).

  MFA supports the following methods:

  - One-Time Password (OTP)
  - SMS
  - Email
  - Passkey
  - Facial recognition
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="Source" type="string">
  User source identifies the user authentication backend. JumpServer supports integrating and enabling multiple authentication services simultaneously. When the same user exists in multiple services, this field helps distinguish the user's source. **Local** user belongs to the local database.

  When a user logs in, the system will, by default, authenticate them using all enabled backends sequentially. Administrators can also configure the system to allow authentication only from the user's source, which helps improve authentication efficiency.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="System roles" type="string[]" required>
  System roles define a user's position in the system and grant only the permissions assigned to each role. Multiple system roles can be assigned, with permissions combined.

  Built-in roles include: 
  - User
  - System Admin
  - System Auditor

  <Callout icon="crown" color="#eab308" iconType="regular">

  A system role grants the user all permissions across all organizations. Administrators can also create custom system roles.
  </Callout>
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="Organization roles" type="string[]" required>

  - Organization Auditor

  You can click **Manage role** to view existing roles or create new ones.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="Active" type="boolean">
  Active controls the user's activation status. Being active is one of the requirements for logging into the system. 

  Additionally, the administrator can configure in System Settings to automatically disable users who have not logged in for an extended period.

<ParamField path="Date expired" type="string">
