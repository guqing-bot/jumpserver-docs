title: "Create push account task"
---

**Account push** means sending local account information from the JumpServer to remote hosts automatically.
This helps create or update accounts on multiple hosts without manual login.
Pushed content includes account name, password or private key.

Before starting account push, create a high-privilege account for the asset. JumpServer uses this account to create other accounts during task execution.
