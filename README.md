JumpServer is an open-source Privileged Access Management (PAM) tool that provides DevOps and IT teams with on-demand and secure access to SSH, RDP, K9s, Remote Apps and Database endpoints through a web browser.

## Quick Start

Then, run `pnpm dev` to start the development server and visit localhost:3000.
