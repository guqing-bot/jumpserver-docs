## About CAS

**Central Authentication Service (CAS)** is a Single Sign-On (SSO) protocol designed to provide centralized authentication for multiple applications. Developed by Yale University, CAS allows users to access multiple protected services with a single login, eliminating the need to re-enter credentials. It implements authentication through a "ticket" mechanism and supports various identity providers, such as databases, LDAP, and OAuth.
