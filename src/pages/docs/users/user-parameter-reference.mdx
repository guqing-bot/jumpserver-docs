# User parameters reference

This topic provides a detailed description of user parameters. All parameters can be provided when creating or updating a user.

### Name

`required`

The name is used to identify a user.

### Username

`required` `unique`

The username is used to log in to JumpServer.

### Email

`required` `unique`

The user email is primarily used to receive system notifications. 
It also supports the following functions:
- Users can use their email as the username to log in to JumpServer.
- Used for password recovery.
- Serves as a backend for multi-factor authentication (MFA) and receive MFA codes.

### Groups

User groups are used for organizing and managing users. A user can belong to multiple groups.

### Password setting

Create local user only.

<dl>
<dt>Reset link will be generated and sent to the user</dt>
<dd>
This will send a password setup email to the user. The user can log in after resetting the password as instructed.
</dd>

<dt>Set password</dt>
<dd>
Manually set password. The user can log in directly with this password.
</dd>
</dl>

### Password

(Local user only) The user can log in to the system using this password. 

Password rules can be configured in the system settings, including requirements for length, uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

When `Password must be changed during next login` is checked, the user will be required to change the password immediately after the first successful login.

### MFA
Configure the Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) policy for a single user. You can also configure a global MFA policy in the system settings.

After MFA is enabled, users will be guided to set up MFA during their first login.

<dl>
<dt>Disabled</dt>
<dd>
MFA is disabled by default, but users can enable it from their profile page. 
</dd>

<dt>Enabled</dt>
<dd>
MFA is enabled for the user, but they can disable it from their profile page.
</dd>

<dt>Force enabled</dt>
<dd>
MFA is enforced for the user, and they cannot disable it.
</dd>
</dl>

MFA backends support the following options, which must be enabled by the administrator in the system settings before users can configure them from their profile page:
- OTP
- SMS
- Email
- Passkey
- Facial recognition

### Source
User source identifies the user authentication backend. JumpServer supports integrating and enabling multiple authentication services simultaneously. When the same user exists in multiple services, this field helps distinguish the user's source. **Local** user belongs to the local database.

When a user logs in, the system will, by default, authenticate them using all enabled backends sequentially. Administrators can also configure the system to allow authentication only from the user's source, which helps improve authentication efficiency.

### System roles

`required`

A system role represents a user's role in the system. A user can have multiple roles simultaneously, inheriting the combined permissions of all assigned roles.

Built-in roles include: 
- User
- System Admin
- System Auditor
