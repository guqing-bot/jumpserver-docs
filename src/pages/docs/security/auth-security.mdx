# Authentication security

This topic introduces configuration parameters for user authentication security.

## Basic

### Login CAPTCHA

`recommended`

Login CAPTCHA (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart) can effectively prevent brute-force attacks by malicious programs.

Once enabled, if a user fails to log in, any subsequent login attempts from the same IP within the next hour will require entering a CAPTCHA.

### Login dynamic code

Login dynamic code is concatenated with the user’s password and sent together to the authentication service for verification.

For example, if the user’s password is "passwd" and the dynamic code is "1234", the system will send "passwd1234" as the password to the backend authentication service during login.

This method is commonly used in scenarios such as RADIUS authentication.

Once enabled, the login CAPTCHA will be disabled.

### Auto disable threshold (day)

Automatically disabled users. 

Users who have not logged in for more than the configured days will be automatically disabled.

For more information about enabling users, see [Enable or disable users](/docs/users/enable-disable-users).

### Suspicious login verification

Remote login alert. 

If a user has not logged in from the city of their most recent login within the past 7 days, the system will send a remote login alert through the user’s enabled message channels (e.g., in-site notifications, email, etc.).
