# Authentication

This topic describes how to configure third-party authentication services and related user authentication settings.



## Integrate CAS auth

**Central Authentication Service (CAS)** is a Single Sign-On (SSO) protocol designed to provide centralized authentication for multiple applications. Developed by Yale University, CAS allows users to access multiple protected services with a single login, eliminating the need to re-enter credentials. It implements authentication through a **ticket** mechanism and supports various identity providers, such as databases, LDAP, and OAuth.

```json copy=true filename="Below is the JumpServer URL information required for CAS setup"
{
  "Login": "https://jumpserver.example.com/core/auth/cas/login/",
  "Login success callback": "https://jumpserver.example.com/core/auth/cas/callback/",
  "Logout": "https://jumpserver.example.com/core/auth/cas/logout/",
}
```


## Integrate Passkey auth

**Passkey** is a passwordless authentication technology based on public-key cryptography. It replaces traditional passwords to enhance security and user experience. Passkey is supported by the FIDO2 standard (including WebAuthn and CTAP) and allows users to authenticate using biometrics (fingerprint or facial recognition), a PIN, or a security key without entering a password.

**Fast Identity Online (FIDO)** is an open standard designed to provide a more secure, passwordless authentication method. It is developed by the FIDO Alliance and primarily includes FIDO UAF (Universal Authentication Framework) and FIDO2 (which consists of the WebAuthn and CTAP protocols).

**Please follow the steps below to configure Passkey service authentication.**

1. In the upper-right corner of any page in JumpServer, click <img src="/images/docs/svg/nav-setting.svg" alt="x" width="15" style={{ display: "inline-block" }}/>.
    <img src="/images/docs/admin-guides/system-settings/nav-settings.png" alt="image" width="450"/>
2. Navigate to **System settings > Authentication > Passkey**.
3. In the **Passkey** field, enable or disable the Passkey authentication.
4. In the **FIDO server ID** field, enter the full domain name of JumpServer. If not set, it defaults to the request host and matches domains in `DOMAINS` from `config.txt` file. If there are multiple domains, separate them with commas.
5. In the **FIDO server name** field, enter the server name, the default value is `JumpServer`.

## Integrate OIDC auth

**OpenID Connect (OIDC)** is an identity authentication protocol based on **OAuth 2.0**. It allows applications to verify a user’s identity through an **authorization server** and obtain basic user information (such as username and email). It adds an identity layer on top of OAuth 2.0, using an **ID Token** to transmit user identity information, and is widely used for Single Sign-On (SSO) and identity authentication systems.

**Relying Party (RP)** is an application or client that uses authentication services and relies on the OpenID provider to authenticate the user and provide identity information.

**OpenID Provider (OP)** is the server responsible for verifying the user’s identity and providing identity information to the RP.

```json copy=true filename="Below is the JumpServer URL information required for OpenID Provider setup"
{
  "Login": "https://jumpserver.example.com/core/auth/openid/login/",
  "Login success callback": "https://jumpserver.example.com/core/auth/openid/callback/",
  "Logout": "https://jumpserver.example.com/core/auth/openid/logout/",
}
```

**Please follow the steps below to configure OIDC service authentication.**

1. In the upper-right corner of any page in JumpServer, click <img src="/images/docs/svg/nav-setting.svg" alt="x" width="15" style={{ display: "inline-block" }}/>.

    <img src="/images/docs/admin-guides/system-settings/nav-settings.png" alt="image" width="450"/>

2. Navigate to **System settings > Authentication > OIDC**.
3. In the **OIDC** field, enable or disable the OIDC authentication.
4. In the **Base site URL** field, enter the full domain name of JumpServer, which is used to construct the callback URL.
5. In the **Client id** field, enter the client id provided by the OIDC server.
6. In the **Client secret** field, enter the client secret provided by the OIDC server.
7. In the **Request method** field, select a method to obtain a token.

    * **Client Secret Basic**: Use the POST method to obtain the token, with the `Client ID` and `Client secret` included in the **headers**.
    * **Client Secret Post**: Use the POST method to obtain a token, with `Client ID` and `Client secret` included as raw data in the **request body**.
    <img src="/images/docs/admin-guides/system-settings/auth/oidc-request-method.png" alt="image" width="550"/>

8. In the **Use keycloak** field, when enabled, Keycloak configuration will be used. The following fields must be provided:

    * **Server**: Enter the Keycloak server URI.
    * **Realm name**: Enter the Keycloak realm name.
    <img src="/images/docs/admin-guides/system-settings/auth/oidc-use-keycloak.png" alt="image" width="550"/>

9. In the **Use keycloak** field, when disabled, native OIDC configuration will be used for better compatibility with other OIDC providers. The following fields must be provided:

    * **Provider endpoint**: Enter the OIDC provider endpoint (such as `https://oidc.example.com`).
    * **Authorization endpoint**: Enter the OIDC authorization endpoint (such as `https://oidc.example.com/realms/JumpServer/protocol/openid-connect/auth/`).
    * **Token endpoint**: Enter the OIDC token endpoint (such as `https://oidc.example.com/realms/JumpServer/protocol/openid-connect/token/`).
    * **JWKS endpoint**: Enter the OIDC JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) endpoint (such as `https://oidc.example.com/realms/JumpServer/protocol/openid-connect/certs/`).
    * **Userinfo endpoint**: Enter the OIDC userinfo endpoint (such as `https://oidc.example.com/realms/JumpServer/protocol/openid-connect/userinfo/`).
    * **End session endpoint**: Enter the OIDC end session endpoint, when the user logs out, this endpoint will be called. (such as `https://oidc.example.com/realms/JumpServer/protocol/openid-connect/logout/`).
    * **Signature algorithm**: Enter the OIDC signature algorithm, valid options are `HS256` and `RS256`.
        * **HS256**: Uses the **Client id** as the shared key.
        * **RS256**: Uses the **Signing Key** as the shared key.
        <Alert type="note">
          The **shared key** in this function is used for Hash-based Message Authentication Code (HMAC) signatures when verifying ID token in an OIDC authentication flow.
        </Alert>
    * **Signing key**: When the **Signature algorithm** is `RS256`, the signing key will be used for HMAC signature verification or JSON Web Token (JWK) decryption to ensure the security of OIDC authentication.
    * **Enable PKCE**: Enable Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) protects the authorization code flow to prevent authorization code interception attacks.
    * **Scopes**: Defines the range of user information that the client requests access to from the OP in an authorization request. Multiple pieces of information are separated by spaces (such as `openid profile email`).
    * **ID token max age (s)**: The maximum age of the ID token, in seconds. After it expires, a new one will be automatically obtained using the refresh token.
    * **ID token include claims**: When enabled, the ID token includes the userinfo scope and claims. When disabled, claims will be retrieved from the userinfo endpoint provided by the OP. Refer to the [Standard Claims](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#StandardClaims).
    * **Use state**: Recommend to enable, state can prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks and ensure consistency between the request and the callback.
    * **Use nonce**: Recommend to enable too, nonce can prevent replay attacks.
    <img src="/images/docs/admin-guides/system-settings/auth/oidc-use-native.png" alt="image" width="700"/>

10. In the **Always update user** field, when enabled, after OIDC user authentication, user information (only includes: `name`, `username`, `email`, `phone`, `comment`) will be checked and updated each time, `groups` are only synchronized when the user is created..
11. In the **Ignore SSL verification** field, when enabled, SSL certificate verification is ignored when sending requests to the OP.
12. In the **Share session** field, when enabled, the session will be logged out simultaneously when a user logs out from other applications.
13. In the **User attribute** field, enter the user attribute mapping. The key is the JumpServer user attribute name (such as `name`, `username`, `email`, `groups`, `phone`, `comment`), and the value is the OIDC user attribute name.
    ```json copy=true filename="User attribute"
    {
      "name": "name",
      "username": "preferred_username",
      "email": "email",
      "groups": "groups"
    }
    ```

14. In the **Organization** field, after authentication and creation, the user will be added to the selected organization.

## Integrate SAML2 auth

**Security Assertion Markup Language 2.0 (SAML2)** is an open standard for exchanging authentication and authorization data between parties, particularly between an Identity Provider and a Service Provider. It allows users to authenticate once with the IdP and access multiple services (SPs) without needing to re-enter credentials.

**Identity Provider (IdP)** is a system that authenticates users and provides their identity information to service providers.

**Service Provider (SP)** is a system or application that relies on an IdP to authenticate users and grant access to its services based on the user identity.

In this case, JumpServer acts only as the SP.

```json copy=true filename="Below is the JumpServer URL information required for IdP SAML2 setup"
{
  "Login": "https://jumpserver.example.com/core/auth/saml2/login/",
  "Login success callback": "https://jumpserver.example.com/core/auth/saml2/callback/",
  "Logout": "https://jumpserver.example.com/core/auth/saml2/logout/",
  "SP metadata": "https://jumpserver.example.com/core/auth/saml2/metadata/"
}
```

**Please follow the steps below to configure SAML2 service authentication.**

1. In the upper-right corner of any page in JumpServer, click <img src="/images/docs/svg/nav-setting.svg" alt="x" width="15" style={{ display: "inline-block" }}/>.

    <img src="/images/docs/admin-guides/system-settings/nav-settings.png" alt="image" width="450"/>

2. Navigate to **System settings > Authentication > SAML2**.
3. In the **SAML2** field, enable or disable the SAML2 authentication.
4. In the **SP private key** field, upload the SP private key file.
5. In the **SP cert** field, upload the SP certificate file. 
    <Alert type="note">
      SP Private Key and SP Certificate are closely linked and work together for secure communication and data protection in SAML2 authentication:
        * **SP Private Key**: Used to sign SAML requests, decrypt encrypted SAML responses from the IdP, and ensure data integrity.
        * **SP Certificate**: Generated from the SP Private Key and provided to the IdP to verify signed requests from the SP. It is also used to encrypt SAML response data, ensuring secure transmission.

      In simple terms, SP Private Key handles singing and decryption, while SP Certificate handles verification and encryption.
    </Alert>

6. In the **IDP metadata URL** field, enter the IdP metadata URL (such as `https://saml2.example.com/realms/JumpServer/protocol/saml/descriptor`).
7. In the **IDP metadata XML** field, you can manually enter the IdP Metadata XML. In practice, you only need to provide either the **IDP metadata URL** or the **IDP metadata XML**. If both are present, the **IDP metadata URL** takes precedence.
8. In the **SP advanced settings** field, enter the information you want to configure. For detailed configuration parameters, please refer to [SP advanced settings](https://github.com/SAML-Toolkits/python3-saml/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file#settings).

    <img src="/images/docs/admin-guides/system-settings/auth/saml2-sp-ad-settings.png" alt="image" width="550"/>

    We will generate SP Metadata based on this configuration for IdP use. 
    <Alert type="note">
      **SP Metadata** is used to provide essential configuration information about the service provider, including entity ID, endpoint URLs, public certificates, and supported bindings, to facilitate secure communication with the identity provider in SAML authentication.
    </Alert>
    
    You can click **View** in the help information below the **SP cert** field to see the SP metadata.
